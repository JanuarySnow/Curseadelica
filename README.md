A modlist that is based around my desire to prepare a feast for my eyes, to always give them something interesting to look at.

I am not insane.

It uses Simonrim and Legacy of the Dragonborn.

It has approximately 20,000 interesting things to explore, summon, fight, find. 

That is all you need to know.

Install from Wabbajack - > go to install folder - > run modorganizer.exe -> then click the arrow next to "run SKSE" in the top right corner.

Enjoy!

( no seriously, enjoy it, you have to. its mandatory)

( seriously tho, if you dont enjoy it, I have ways of making sure you do, pray I dont use those ways )
