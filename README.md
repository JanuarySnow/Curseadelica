A lightweight Wabbajack modlist for Skyrim Special Edition

Preamble:

This is a lightweight, tightly focused modlist, which aims to keep mostly close to Bethesdas original vision for Skyrim, no massive overhauls or gameplay changes, with a unique visual style.

Installation :

After installing the Wabbajack file, drag and drop the contents of Game Folder Files into your Skyrim Special Edition folder

Mod Configuration :

TODO , but mostly click around and have a look

Notable mods:

Um, Ive forgotten most of them, I think theres Pikachu, and some NPCs may look different, I saw star wars stormtroppers around so I think theres a portal to Star Wars somewhere, and also a portal to Super Mario World, and you may find the dragonborn has different dialogue options.

For a mage focused playthrough , there are additional spells, and if you press the numpad enter key and numpad buttons, random magical effects occur.

The courier is now a spider.

Dragons are now Thomas the Tank Engine.

There are lots of hidden things to find and craft, like dildo clubs and magic mushrooms.

Talos is now Shrek.

um what else....

Oh yeah everytime you fast travel it sends you somewhere random.

But other than that, id describe it as vanilla+

Final notes:

I'm sorry.
